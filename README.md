# RIOTS Introduction to Python talk

This is a repository for a talk to the RIOTS club as an introduction to Python and some tools around it that support reproducibility, interoperability and openness. 

These are large subjects, so any resource is likely to be missing something and it is based on my experience. 

## Binder

This is a Binder notebook to support the first part of the talk.
