## Jupyter

Jupyter is an interactive environment that allows you to run code and document it as you go along. It supports Python by default but you can get it to run R and Julia as well. 

Jupyter is not installed with Python (unless you are using Anaconda where it is a default package). It can be installed through pip ```pip install jupyter``` or ```pip3 install jupyter```. 

Once installed and you have changed into the directory where you are working, it can be started using

```jupyter notebook```

You should see the homescreen.

Open a new notebook from the screen options. I chose a Python 3 notebook. 

By default, the notebook is called "Untitled". If you click on it, you can change it to something meaningful. This also changes the filename to match itso it is helpful to find the notebook later.
